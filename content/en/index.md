Apia is an opinionated framework for building HTTP APIs into a Ruby application. By following a strict approach to crafting your endpoints, Apia is able to generate a consistent schema describing every aspect of the API and thus can generate detailed and easy to use documentation for end users.

## Why should I use Apia?

- Clear and easy to understand DSL for implementing all aspects of the API.
- Provide auto generated schemas describing your API.
- Documentation can be generated automatically.

## Key components of Apia

- [Apia](https://github.com/apiaframework/apia) - the framework for actually writing and serving APIs.
- [Apia Docs Generator](https://github.com/apiaframework/docs-generator) - a utility for converting a Apia schema JSON file into beautiful interactive documentation.
- [Apia Schema Parser](https://github.com/apiaframework/schema-parser) - a utility to parse an Apia schema in Ruby
- [Apia Insomnia](https://github.com/apiaframework/insomnia) - an extension to generate schema files compatible with Insomnia.

## What do the docs look like?
